//To make cars & junctions work you need to create tags: 'Waypoint' and 'Junction'
//Also you need to create layer: 'Car'
//As you get 'Waypoint' tags are used by waypoint triggers, and 'Junction' tags are used by junction triggers
//Cars are set on 'Car' layer and in their 'Car AI' script in 'Deceleration Layer' is chosen 'Car' too, so car's will see each-other and won't collide/go through each-other.
