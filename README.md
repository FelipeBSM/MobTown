# MobTown


Mob Town is a game that seeks to simulate an urban environment, containing elements more focused on fun/relaxation than realism.

Manage your taxi company, buy upgrades and elements for your vehicle. Be careful not to get into an accident... it could cost you more than you imagine!

I´ve made this game in 2021/2 in order to get my degree! The main systems are all working well, i should maybe improve and clean the code a little bit, but u know...

Anyway, hope u like, i´ll leave some basic instructions down bellow! Byeeee!
